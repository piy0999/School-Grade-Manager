This is the JAVA code for a basic school result management system. 
It has a lot of features and is connected to the MySQL database to store the data of the students and the teachers. 
Also the program is capable of entering, displaying the marks of each student in three different curriculums. 
This also contains the database for the teachers so that only the teachers can login and manipulate the data in the system. 
Thus, all the operations are performed by java but MySQL JDBC connectivity helps storing the data in the relational database tables which can be efficiently managed.
(NOTE: This is a prototype of the full-stack program with most basic interface. However, the Java code is similar to the originally working application.)
